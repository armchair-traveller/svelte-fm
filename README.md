All Front End Mentor challenges done in Svelte.

## But Why Svelte?

Easy question! Svelte:

- Has syntax that is basically equivalent to vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS). Because of this, this code can be easily easily adapted by anyone to other component frameworks or even back to vanilla, with minimal context. All while keeping the features and tooling of a full framework available at any time.
- Component scoped: dial down complexity by separation into components when needed, keep it all in one file when not. This means VSCode's symbol search (CTRL+O) is doubly effective! Just search the class names.
- When it's just CSS & HTML, it's just CSS & HTML. But when there's any JS involved, it's vastly more productive and less complex to work in than React or Vue, because of its declarative syntax.
