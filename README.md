# Svelte Front End Mentor

All Front End Mentor challenges done in Svelte.

## But Why Svelte?

Easy question! Svelte:

- Has syntax that is basically equivalent to vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS).
- All in one file - dial down complexity by separation into components when needed. This means VSCode's symbol search (CTRL+O) is doubly effective as long as you're attaching the right classes!
- When it's just CSS & HTML, it's just CSS & HTML. But when there's any JS involved, it's vastly more productive and less complex to work in than React or Vue, because of its declarative syntax.
